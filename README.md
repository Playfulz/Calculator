# Calculator
Discord RPG bot that was supposed to be developed by Playful, MSN, and Manfiest. 

- `Playful` Main Dev
- `Ucalgen` Does things in javascript and is obsessed with chicken nuggets
- `Manifest` Left the project development because he strictly uses javascript while the project is in c sharp.
- `MSN` I have no idea what happened to him shaking my kidneys.
